Practical No 3.
Perform testing of hypothesis using one sample t-test. One sample t-test : The One Sample t Test determines whether the sample mean is statistically different from a known or hypothesised population mean. The One Sample t Test is a parametric test.
from scipy.stats import ttest_1samp
import numpy as np
file = open("D:/sheetal/M.Sc/RIC_Journal/ages.csv")
ages =np.loadtxt(file, delimiter=",")
print(ages)
ages_mean = np.mean(ages)
tset, pval = ttest_1samp(ages, 30)
print('p-values - ',pval)
if pval< 0.05: # alpha value is 0.05
  print("we are rejecting null hypothesis")
else:
  print("we are accepting null hypothesis")
